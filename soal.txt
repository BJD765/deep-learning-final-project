1.	Purpose
The final project provides students with an opportunity to integrate theoretical knowledge and practical skills in Deep Learning. Students will experience the end-to-end process of designing, implementing, and evaluating a deep learning solution that addresses a real-world challenge.

2.	Learning Outcomes (LOs)
LO 1: Execute structured deep learning experimentation workflows, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
LO 2: Construct deep learning models using modern programming tools and frameworks.
LO 3: Analyze the behavior and performance of theoretical and practical deep learning models under various training scenarios.
LO 4: Evaluate the suitability and limitations of different deep learning approaches for solving real-world problems across domains

3.	Mapping of Deliverables to LOs

Deliverable	Aligned LOs
Application	LO 1, LO 2
Written Report	LO 3, LO 4
Demo Video	LO 3, LO 4

4.	Suggested Themes
• Image Classification / Object Detection
• Generative Models (e.g., diffusion, text-to-image)
• Time Series Prediction / Anomaly Detection
• Reinforcement Learning (e.g., game agent, robotics)
• Multi-Modal Learning (e.g., video understanding, text+image retrieval)

5.	Technical Notes
• Language: Python
• Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
• Platforms: Flask, Django, Streamlit, FastAPI (with instructor approval)

6.	Project Proposal (Checkpoint)
Submit by Week 6 (1–2 pages):
• Project title and problem statement
• Dataset source and description (including licensing/permissions)
• Initial plan for model/methodology and baseline
• Planned evaluation metrics and success criteria
• References (> 2–3 relevant works)

7.	Deliverables & Weights
• Application (40%) — Functional prototype with a user interface; includes input, model execution, clear outputs
• Written Report (40%) — 10–15 pages, academic style; follows required structure; includes analysis and reflection
• Demo Video (20%) — < 5 minutes; explains problem, workflow, and results with professional narration

8.	Required Report Structure
• Title Page (Project Title, Team Members, Course Code, Semester)
• Abstract
• Introduction (background, problem statement, objectives, significance)
• Related Work (summary of relevant literature or existing solutions)
• Methodology (dataset, preprocessing, model architecture, training setup, evaluation metrics)
• Implementation & Results (system details, experiments, visualizations, results obtained)
• Discussion & Limitations (analysis of performance, challenges, trade-offs)
• Conclusion & Future Work
• References (IEEE/APA format)
• Appendix (team contribution statement, screenshots, code snippets)

9.	Dataset Policy
• Use legal and ethically sourced datasets (public/open-source or collected with proper consent)
• If collecting data: document the collection process and preprocessing steps
• Ensure dataset size and quality are sufficient for meaningful experimentation
• Disclose any data limitations (e.g., imbalance, missing values) and mitigation strategies

10.	Ethics & Responsible AI
• Avoid unfair bias and discrimination in dataset/model design
• Ensure transparency/explainability of results where feasible
• Protect privacy and handle sensitive data responsibly
• Avoid harmful or unethical applications of AI

11.	Team Contribution Statement
• List specific contributions per member (data, preprocessing, modeling, UI/app, report)
• Highlight shared tasks and coordination methods (e.g., Git, issue tracker)
• Include weekly/biweekly contribution logs if requested by instructor
